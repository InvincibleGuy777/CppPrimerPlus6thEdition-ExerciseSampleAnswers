We could compare the result above to the output of **bank.cpp with the same input**:

```
Case Study: Bank of Heather Automatic Teller
Enter maximum size of queue: 10
Enter the number of simulation hours: 100
Enter the average number of customers per hour: 15
customers accepted: 1464
  customers served: 1464
         turnaways: 0
average queue size: 0.14
 average wait time: 0.58 minutes
Done!

```

**The rough comparation of both results implies that my program may be True.**
