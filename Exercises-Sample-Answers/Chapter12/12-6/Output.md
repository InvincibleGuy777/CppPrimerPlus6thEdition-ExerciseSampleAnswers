### OUTPUT 12-6
```
Case Study: Bank of Heather Automatic Teller
Enter maximum size of queue: 10
Enter the number of simulation hours: 100
Simulation start! (With Two ATMs)
Iteration success.
customers accepted: 4981
  customers served: 4981
         turnaways: 0
average queue size: 0.83

```

We could compare the result above to the output of **12-5 bankATM.cpp with the same input**:

```
Case Study: Bank of Heather Automatic Teller
Enter maximum size of queue: 10
Enter the number of simulation hours: 100
Simulation start!
Iteration success.
customers accepted: 1810
  customers served: 1809
         turnaways: 0
average queue size: 0.30
 average number of customers per hour(Answer): 17.51
 average wait time: 1.00 minutes
Done!
Total time cost: 39 s

```

**From the results above,  we could get that problem 12-6 is a non-linear problem.**

**ps: the total running time got a sharp increase. (39s -> 242s)**
